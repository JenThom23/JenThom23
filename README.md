👋 Hi, I’m @JenThom23

👀 I’m interested in turning cyber threats into digital playgrounds and making the internet a safer place for everyone! 🌐💪

🌱 I’m currently learning how to hack my way into the world of quantum encryption and stay one step ahead of digital mischief-makers. 🔍🚀

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on epic security challenges, open-source projects that make the web a safer place, and geek out over new cybersecurity innovations! 🤝💻

📫 How to reach me: jeniben28@gmail.com or hit me up on Twitter for some cybersecurity banter! 📧🐦

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I once stopped a phishing attack with nothing but a cup of tea and a well-placed IOC! ☕🛡️
